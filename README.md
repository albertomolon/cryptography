# Cryptography
List of algorithms analyzed during the 'Cryptography' course from the 'Master Degree in ICT Engineering', University of Padova, A.Y. 2020/2021.

## Primality test algorithms
**Goal:** state whether a given natural number is prime or composite.

**Content:**
 - [Miller-Rabin's test](https://github.com/mollylandd/cryptography/blob/master/1-primality-test-algorithms/miller-rabin-test.ipynb)
 - [Akrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) algorithm](https://github.com/mollylandd/cryptography/blob/master/1-primality-test-algorithms/aks-test.ipynb)
 - [Eratosthenes' sieve](https://github.com/mollylandd/cryptography/blob/master/1-primality-test-algorithms/eratosthenes-%20sieve.ipynb)

## Factoring algorithms
**Goal:** find (at least) one divisor of a given natural number.

**Content:**
 - [Trial-division method](https://github.com/mollylandd/cryptography/blob/master/2-factoring-algorithms/trial-division-method.ipynb)
 - [Fermat factoring algorithm](https://github.com/mollylandd/cryptography/blob/master/2-factoring-algorithms/fermat-factoring.ipynb)

### Prerequisites
It is used [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with ``` jupyter-notebook```. Then you also need the following modules:
- ``` mpmath ``` => ``` pip install mpmath ```
- ``` sympy ``` => ``` pip install sympy ```
