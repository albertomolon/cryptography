# Cryptography
List of algorithms analyzed during the 'Cryptography' course from the 'Master Degree in ICT Engineering', University of Padova, A.Y. 2020/2021.

## Primality test algorithms
**Goal:** state whether a given natural number is prime or composite.

**Content:**
 - [Miller-Rabin's test]()
 - [Akrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) algorithm]()
 - [Eratosthenes' sieve]()

## Factoring algorithms
**Goal:** find (at least) one divisor of a given natural number.

**Content:**
 - [Trial-division method]()
 - [Fermat factoring algorithm]()
 - [Pollard's rho method with Floyd iterations]()

### Prerequisites
It is used [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then you also need the following modules:
- ``` mpmath ``` => ``` pip install mpmath ```
- ``` gmpy2 ``` => ``` pip install gmpy2 ```
